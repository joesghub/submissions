### I tested writing the response output to a file then working on the file to build my code around a static response. ###

#resp = response.json()
#recipe = json.dumps(resp)

# f = open( '/home/ubuntu/submissions/submissions/Testing/recipe.py', 'w' )
# f.write( recipe )
# f.close()

# recipe = open('/home/ubuntu/submissions/submissions/Testing/recipe.py', 'r')
# read_recipe = json.load(recipe)
#print(type(read_recipe))
#print(read_recipe.keys())
#print(type(read_recipe['ingredients']))
#print(read_recipe['ingredients'])


### REFERENCE METHODS ###

### Convert into JSON:
# y = json.dumps(read)

### Open and read the JSON file
# with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
#     data = json.load(file)

### Opening JSON file
# f = open('data.json')

### Returns JSON object as a dictionary
# data = json.load(f)

### Closing file
# f.close()
